# Local Tauri Builds

Cursor sets `CI=1` in its shell environment. Tauri CLI interprets this as `--ci 1`, which fails because it only accepts `true`/`false`.

**Always unset `CI` before running Tauri commands:**

```bash
# Dev
unset CI && pnpm tauri dev

# Build
unset CI && pnpm tauri build

# Build for specific target
unset CI && pnpm tauri build --target aarch64-apple-darwin
```

`CI=` (empty string) does NOT work -- Tauri still sees the flag. You must fully `unset CI`.

Never run bare `pnpm tauri build` or `pnpm tauri dev` from the Cursor terminal.
