# Release Workflow

## Before Creating a Release Tag

When the user asks to push a tag or create a release:

1. **Update RELEASE_NOTES.md** with a summary of changes since the last release
   - Use `git log --oneline <last-tag>..HEAD` to see commits
   - Group changes by category: Features, Bug Fixes, Improvements
   - Keep it concise but informative for end users

2. **Update version in package.json** to match the new tag

3. **Commit release notes** before creating the tag

## Tag Format

- Use `app-v<version>` format (e.g., `app-v0.6.3`)
- Version follows semver: `major.minor.patch`

## After Tagging

Provide links to monitor the build:
- GitHub Actions: `https://github.com/spearssoftware/BibleMarker/actions`
- Release page: `https://github.com/spearssoftware/BibleMarker/releases/tag/<tag>`
