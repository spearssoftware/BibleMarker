# Release Workflow

## REQUIRED Before Creating Any Release Tag

When pushing a tag or creating a release, you MUST complete ALL these steps:

### 1. Check What Changed
```bash
git log --oneline <last-tag>..HEAD
```

### 2. Update RELEASE_NOTES.md Content (NOT just version number)
- **Replace** the entire file with notes for this release only
- RELEASE_NOTES.md should only contain the CURRENT version's notes — old version history lives in git
- Update the version number in the heading
- **Write a NEW description** of what changed in this specific release
- Group by: Features, Bug Fixes, Improvements
- Be specific about user-visible changes
- Keep the macOS/Windows install tips at the bottom

### 3. Update package.json Version
Match the version to the new tag.

### 4. Commit BEFORE Tagging
```bash
git add RELEASE_NOTES.md package.json
git commit -m "Release vX.Y.Z: <brief description>"
```

### 5. Then Create and Push Tag
```bash
git push origin main && git tag app-vX.Y.Z && git push origin app-vX.Y.Z
```

## DO NOT
- Push a tag without updating release notes content
- Copy the same release notes from previous version
- Skip describing what changed in this release
- Include notes from previous versions in RELEASE_NOTES.md (the workflow uses `--notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md` so the entire file becomes the GitHub release body)

## Tag Format
- Use `app-v<version>` format (e.g., `app-v0.6.4`)
- Version follows semver: `major.minor.patch`

## After Tagging
Provide monitoring links:
- Actions: `https://github.com/spearssoftware/BibleMarker/actions`
- Release: `https://github.com/spearssoftware/BibleMarker/releases/tag/<tag>`
