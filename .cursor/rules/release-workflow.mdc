# Release Workflow

Extends `release-workflow` skill with BibleMarker tag format and file names.

## BibleMarker specifics

- **Tag format**: `app-vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `app-v0.6.4`), semver
- **Release notes file**: `RELEASE_NOTES.md` — entire file becomes GitHub release body via `--notes-file`
- **Keep** the Windows install tip at the bottom of RELEASE_NOTES.md

## Commands

```bash
git log --oneline <last-tag>..HEAD
git add RELEASE_NOTES.md package.json
git commit -m "Release vX.Y.Z: <brief description>"
git push origin main && git tag app-vX.Y.Z && git push origin app-vX.Y.Z
```

## DO NOT

- Push a tag without updating release notes content
- Copy the same release notes from previous version
- Skip describing what changed
- Include notes from previous versions in RELEASE_NOTES.md
- When retagging, replace the original notes with only the fix notes — always combine

## Retagging

```bash
gh release delete app-vX.Y.Z --yes
git push origin :refs/tags/app-vX.Y.Z
git tag -d app-vX.Y.Z
# Update RELEASE_NOTES.md if needed (combine, don't replace)
git tag app-vX.Y.Z
git push origin app-vX.Y.Z
```

## After Tagging

- Release: `https://github.com/spearssoftware/BibleMarker/releases/tag/<tag>`
