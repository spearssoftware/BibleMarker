# Before Completing Tasks

## Run Tests

Run `pnpm test` if you modified files in directories that have existing tests (check for `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` files nearby).

## Type Check

Run `pnpm tsc --noEmit` before committing if you changed TypeScript files — especially after store/interface refactors that may affect multiple consumers.

## Check Lints

Run linter checks on modified files and fix any errors you introduced.

## Documentation

Only update documentation if the change affects:
- User-facing behavior
- Public API or exported interfaces
- Setup/installation steps

Don't add documentation just to satisfy this rule — most internal changes don't need doc updates.
