## Installation

### Desktop App (macOS, Windows, Linux)

BibleMarker is built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app) for native desktop performance.

#### Downloading a pre-built release (macOS)

Pre-built macOS apps are not code-signed (no Apple Developer certificate). When you download the app from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/spearssoftware/BibleMarker/releases), macOS may show **"BibleMarker is damaged and can't be opened"**. The app is not actually damaged—this is Gatekeeper blocking unsigned downloads.

**To open the app:**

1. **Right-click** (or Control-click) the BibleMarker app.
2. Choose **Open**, then click **Open** in the dialog.

Alternatively, remove the quarantine attribute in Terminal (replace the path with where you placed the app):

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/BibleMarker.app
```

After that, you can open the app normally.

**Windows:** SmartScreen may show "Windows protected your PC" for unsigned downloads. Click **More info** → **Run anyway** to install or run. To remove the warning entirely (signed builds), see [docs/WINDOWS_CODE_SIGNING.md](./docs/WINDOWS_CODE_SIGNING.md).

#### Building from source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spearssoftware/BibleMarker.git
cd biblemarker
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
pnpm install
```

3. Run in development mode:
```bash
pnpm tauri:dev
```

4. Build for production:
```bash
pnpm tauri:build
```

See [docs/MAC_APP_GUIDE.md](./docs/MAC_APP_GUIDE.md) for detailed macOS-specific instructions.

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Run development server:

## Configuration

### Bible API Keys (Optional)

While the app works without API keys using the free getBible service, you can configure additional providers for more translation options:
