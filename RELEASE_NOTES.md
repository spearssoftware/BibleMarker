# BibleMarker v0.7.7

## Features

- **In-app auto-update (macOS/Windows)**: When an update is available, a dialog prompts you immediately on launch. Click "Update now" to download and install with a progress bar — the app restarts automatically. Falls back to manual download if something goes wrong.

## Improvements

- Update check runs on every app startup (previously throttled to once per day)
- Update banner on iOS now correctly directs to the App Store instead of showing a download button
- Fixed update banner overlapping the iOS status bar

**Windows:** SmartScreen may warn for unsigned builds. Click **More info** → **Run anyway**.
