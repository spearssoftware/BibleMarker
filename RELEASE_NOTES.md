# BibleMarker v0.7.8

## Improvements

- **Observation lists start collapsed**: Time, People, and Places keyword groups now start contracted instead of expanded, reducing visual clutter
- **Time expressions grouped by chapter**: Time tab now organizes expressions by chapter within each keyword group, with aggregated year/era shown on the chapter header
- **Year era defaults to BC for OT books**: When editing a time expression in an Old Testament book, the year era now correctly defaults to BC instead of AD
