These Terms and Conditions include a provision binding you to arbitration of any dispute you may have with respect to your use of the site, API.Bible and its services, content and entities, pursuant to which you relinquish your right to bring an action in court and to a jury trial. Particular pages, services, content, or features of the Site may have different or additional terms ("Special Terms"), which will be disclosed to you when you access those pages or features, or will be explained in this terms and conditions document, and which include copyright policies. By accessing or using such pages, features, and content, you will be deemed to have agreed to the applicable Special Terms. If there is a conflict between these Terms and Conditions and the Special Terms, the Special Terms will govern with respect to such pages or features or content. We reserve the right to change the Terms and Conditions upon notice, which may be given by posting such change on the Site, by email, or any other reasonable method. Your continued use of the Site following notice of such modifications will be conclusively deemed acceptance of any changes to these Terms and Conditions.

If you do not wish to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, you should not use this Site, API, or its affiliated products, content and services.

ANY USER RESIDENT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, BY USE OF THE SITE TO MAKE A DONATION, SUBMISSION OR SUBSCRIPTION TO, OR MAKE A PURCHASE FROM, ABS, UNAMBIGUOUSLY AND FREELY SIGNIFIES ACCEPTANCE OF ANY RESULTING TRANSFER OF THEIR PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA.

3. Grant of License

We are providing you with a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, revocable at our discretion, to use the Site, API.Bible, the API, the API Content, and its service and features. Except as expressly provided herein, we are not granting any express or implied right in the Site, service, or any of its content. API.Bible does not grant you license to use any Third Party IP Content offered via API.Bible.
In addition to API Content, API.Bible may also provide access to additional content, referred to here as “Third Party IP Content,” offered to you via a direct license with a third party IP Holder or organization (e.g., Biblica Inc). You agree to carefully follow all terms and conditions of any third party license and IP Holder with which you enter into agreement to access content on API.Bible.
Depending upon the country of the developer and application, developers may be required to implement data analytics gathering services as a term and condition of using API.Bible and its services. Specifically, any webapp must implement FUMs in order to use API.Bible, unless otherwise prohibited by law in local jurisdictions. Additional details regarding FUMs are provided later in this document.
This agreement does not constitute and will not be construed as constituting a partnership, joint venture, principal-agent or employer-employee relationship between the parties hereto.
API.Bible reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate, suspend, or revoke your license and/or access to the API, any API Content, or any Third Party IP Content, at any time, with or without notice, for any reason or no reason, including but not limited to breach of these Terms or violation of applicable law.
4. License terms

All content accessed via API.Bible and any of it’s services, sites or features are subject to copyright policies and content terms as described in this document.

You are not authorized to alter, modify, and/or introduce changes to any part of the structure or content of the API Content or Third Party IP Content.
You are not authorized to sublicense or distribute all or part of the API Content or Third Party IP Content to any third party without approval in writing from API.Bible.
You acknowledge that copyright IP Holders are the sole and exclusive owner of the content and/or Third Party IP content and of all Marks and all copyrights and trademarks associated with Third Party IP Content and is used with permission exclusively in connection with and limited to the application that is subscribed to API.Bible and its services.
Although use of all API.Bible API Content must adhere to the standards, terms, and conditions as described in this document, some use of some content will be dependent upon additional restrictions, terms, and conditions. You are responsible for identifying, understanding, and adhering to these requirements. In using API.Bible, you agree to accept all penalties and costs associated with any misuse or violations of these terms and conditions. Additional copyright information can be found via the copyright field in the metadata for the /Bibles endpoint of the API.Bible API (e.g. Full Details = true). If you have questions about information returned for a specific Bible ID or IP entity, please reach out directly to support@api.bible.
API content accessible via API.Bible API, including texts that are default accessible with your API plan, may be provided under Creative Commons licenses. Specific attention should be paid to restrictions depending upon which Creative Commons license under which the text is available to you. For legal restrictions and licensing details, you agree to review and follow the terms, conditions and details as provided at https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/.
5. Third Party IP License terms

Some IP Content accessible via API.Bible may be provided only after the user has entered into a direct licensing agreement with an IP Holder for use of and access to their IP. In this situation, the user agrees to fully follow and agree to the terms of the license agreement with the IP Holder with respect to the IP Holder’s IP. When there are additional requirements regarding Third Party IP use, the user agrees to implement and abide by those requirements.
With the exception of copyright recognition requirements, formatting, and citation details, the direct End User agreements do not overwrite or change any minimum requirements for use of API.Bible. In order to use API.Bible, you agree to follow both API.Bible requirements for all content, as well as any additional requirements or restrictions for specific Third Party IP content as it is licensed to you directly from the IP Holder.
Third Party IP Holders may require additional information, links, formatting, and citation methodology different than API.Bible’s typical approach. As the IP Content is from the Third Party IP Holder, you must follow the instructions and requirements from a direct end user license agreement for the IP content from that agreement, rather than the API.Bible prescribed approach. However, you must still cite and link to API.Bible as described in the API.Bible recognitions of copyright and API.Bible terms and conditions.
API Content and Third Party IP content accessible via API.Bible is provided under a stringent requirement that no potentially controversial use of API Content or Third Party IP content is allowed (e.g. numerology, critical race theory, critical queer theory, etc).
If there are any perceived discrepancies or conflicts between the minimum requirements of API.Bible Terms and Conditions and any End User License you enter into on or via API.Bible, you agree to reach out to API.Bible to identify and discuss these issues immediately and prior to use of the content. You can reach API.Bible at support@api.bible.
6. Intellectual Property Rights

Right to Use; (a) All material contained on or from the Site and API service, unless otherwise indicated, is protected by law including, but not limited to, United States copyright and trademark law, as well as other laws and regulations. We refer you to Special Terms. (b) The Site, service, its content, layout and design are our exclusive property or the property of those from whom we have licensed it and/or any Third Party IP Holders. In particular and without limitation, we own the copyright in the Site and service as a collective work and/or compilation. We also own the copyright on or hold a license or usage agreement for any databases accessible on the Site, and in the selection, coordination, arrangement, aggregation and enhancement of the content of the Site. If you believe the Site or service is infringing copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by you or by someone on whose behalf you are authorized to act, please contact us at: support@api.bible. (c) Our logo, and all other names, logos, and icons identifying us and our products and services are our proprietary marks. Third party product and company names mentioned herein are the trademarks of their respective owners. YOU MAY NOT USE ANY SUCH TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, SERVICE MARKS, OR LOGOS IN ANY MANNER WHICH CREATES THE IMPRESSION THAT SUCH ITEMS BELONG TO OR ARE ASSOCIATED WITH YOU OR, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN, ARE USED WITH OUR CONSENT, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE NO OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN AND TO ANY OF SUCH ITEMS.

7. Copyright Recognition

In using any API Content from API.Bible that is not clearly identified as Public Domain text, you must fully integrate and execute the following requirements regarding citations, providing copyright information, linking to IP Holder organizations websites, as well as citing and linking to API.Bible in your digital website or application.

Full Copyright Information. For any and all content from API.Bible, excluding explicitly labeled Public Domain content, but including Creative Commons content, you must include on a "copyright" page of your website or app that is linked to by a citation within your app. The Bible translation name must be identified, the proper abbreviation must be used, the appropriate IP Holder information cited and a link must be provided to the IP Holder’s website. This information is provided via the meta-data in the output of the API call for a Bible version. See APPENDIX A for formatting guidance and examples for both Licensed or Copyright Reserved contents, as well as Creative-Commons licensed and Public Domain content. See APPENDIX B for website links to several key IP Holder organizations.
Citations in context. Attribution must be given for any and all content sourced via API.Bible and its services. Any quotation or use of content must clearly indicate the name / identification of the content source title on the page it is being read. For occasional and/or individual Scripture quotations within the context of other content or media, it is encouraged to provide the citation immediately after the Scripture quote (e.g., “Jesus started crying - John 11:35 (CEV)”). Abbreviations are allowed and encouraged within use of your website or digital app (e.g., “(CEV)”) since a full copyright information citation is required within the website or app upon first using the app or website. The abbreviation must be the abbreviation provided in the meta-data from the API.Bible API. Each page on which a citation is used must also include a link to the full copyright information for the cited material. The link to the full citation may be within the actual citation (e.g., “CEV” hyperlinked), or the link may be somewhere else on the page, such as at the bottom of the page/app.
API Third Party citation requirements
Access to certain content on API.Bible API may require specific and/or special end user licensing agreements. For content licensed directly via an end user agreement with an IP Holder via API.Bible, the copyright information, citation requirements, and copyright and citation formatting requirements, if different, replace the aforementioned IP content recognition requirements (Full Copyright Information section, and Citations in context section). You agree to follow both the API.Bible API Terms and Conditions as a minimum standard, as well as any additional terms of use, conditions, and restrictions identified in the Third Party IP license agreement.
8. Prohibited Use

Copyrighted content provided in text format is only for use as text, and copyrighted audio content is only for use as audio. Creating text to audio, or audio to text, may constitute a derivative work and an infringement of our copyright. Uses such as AI driven text-to-speech are not allowed for copyright content without prior written consent from API.Bible and the content’s Intellectual Property owner.
Ephemeral, or temporary, text-to-speech features are allowed for clearly marked Public Domain content, and some creative-commons licenses as permitted by the specific creative commons license. You bear the burden to identify and understand permissions of each content license type prior to enabling or providing text-to-speech features. Text-to-Audio recordings for download outside of use in your app are clearly prohibited. Your app may only allow for one Bible chapter of audio at a time for text-to-audio features derived from a Public Domain or creative-commons compliant text sourced from Api.Bible.
Artificial Intelligence restrictions. The use of any copyright content, including Creative Commons licensed content, accessed via API.Bible for training generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Large Language Models (LLMs), is strictly prohibited without the express written consent of both API.Bible and the copyright content’s IP Holder.
Commercial use restrictions. If your Services are designated as ‘non-commercial,’ you shall not make Commercial Use of the API content. “Commercial Use” means any use of the API.Bible service, content, and/or API content or access to the API.Bible API: (a) by or for a business (i.e. an entity whose primary purpose is to earn revenue through a product or service), or (b) as part of a product or service that is monetized (e.g., website advertising, licensing fees, in-app promotions, sponsorships, freemium models, paid access to the app/website or any other situation that may reasonably be considered as a revenue generating activity).
Rate Limitations. You will not attempt to exceed or circumvent limitations on access, calls and use of the API (“Allowance Limits,” "Rate Limits"), or otherwise use API.Bible in a manner that exceeds reasonable request volume, constitutes excessive or abusive usage, or otherwise does not comply with this Agreement. If you exceed or API.Bible reasonably believes that you have attempted to circumvent Allowance or Rate Limits, controls to limit use of the API.Bible’s APIs or the terms of this agreement, then your ability to use the API content may be temporarily suspended or permanently blocked. API.Bible may monitor your use of the API.Bible API to improve the API content and applications and to ensure your compliance with this agreement and Incorporated Developer Terms.
Reverse Engineering and other Restrictions. You shall not attempt to (or allow or enable others to): (a) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or translate the API.Bible API, or otherwise attempt to derive source code, trade secrets or know-how in or underlying any API.Bible API or any portion thereof; (b) interfere with, modify, disrupt or disable features or functionality of the API.Bible API or monitoring mechanisms of the API.Bible API; (c) use or access the API content to create or attempt to create a substitute or similar service or product to the API.Bible Applications; (d) sell, rent, lease, sublicense, distribute, redistribute, syndicate, create derivative works of, assign or otherwise transfer or provide access to, in whole or in part, the API content to any third party except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; (e) provide use of the API.Bible API on a service bureau, rental or managed services basis or permit other individuals or entities to create links to the API.Bible API or "frame" or "mirror" the API.Bible API on any other server, or wireless or Internet-based device, or otherwise make available to a third party, any token, key, password or other login credentials to the API.Bible API; (f) use the API content for any illegal, unauthorized or other improper purposes; (g) use the API content to derive or obtain non-public information of individual API.Bible users; (h) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the API.Bible Applications, API.Bible API or API.Bible Content contained therein; (i) remove or alter any proprietary notices or marks on the API Content; (j) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the API.Bible Applications, API.Bible API, API.Bible Content or related systems or networks, or (k) use API.Bible Content, by itself or bundled with third party data, or derivative analysis therefrom, to target or serve users with advertising outside of the API.Bible Applications.
10. Duration of Use

The user agrees to only use content from API.Bible for which they currently have permitted access from API.Bible with its active API.Bible plan for its application.
Upon termination of a given IP license, suspension by API.Bible, and/or upon termination or deactivation of the user’s API.Bible subscription plan, the user agrees to remove any and all IP and content provided from API.Bible and its services from user’s applications, properties, etc. An unpaid subscription plan is considered to be deactivated, and content must be removed. Content must be removed within 72 hours for a terminated or deactivated subscription, application and/or account.
The user agrees to remove designated content from API.Bible services if directed for any reason upon request of API.Bible and/or IP Holder, within 72 hours.
11. Content Recency Requirements

If you store API.Bible Content and/or Third Party IP Content offline, you must keep it up to date with the current state of that content in API.Bible. Specifically, you must delete or modify any content you have if it is deleted or modified in API.Bible. You are required to check at least every 30 days for content updates. This must be done as soon as reasonably possible, or within 24 hours after receiving a request to do so by API.Bible or the applicable IP content owner, or as otherwise required by your agreement with API.Bible or applicable law. This must be done unless it is prohibited by law, and only then, with the express written permission of API.Bible.

12. Security

You will maintain the security of the API.Bible API, and will not make available to any third party, any token, key, password or other login credentials to the API.Bible API. You will use industry standard security measures to prevent unauthorized access or use of any of the features and functionality of the API.Bible API, including access by viruses, worms, or any other harmful code or material. You shall keep API.Bible Content confidential and secure from unauthorized access by using industry-standard organizational and technical safeguards for such data, and with no less care than you use in connection with securing similar data you store. You will immediately notify API.Bible (support@api.bible), consult and cooperate with investigations, assist with any required notices, and provide any information reasonably requested by API.Bible if you know of or suspect any breach of security or potential vulnerability related to the API content. You will promptly remedy such breach or potential vulnerability resulting from your access to the API content.

Users may only use content from API.Bible and its services in a secured manner that does not allow the property to be freely copied. Users will incorporate industry-standard digital rights management (“DRM”) technology into products which restricts end users from copying or distributing the Licensed Products and the Property, restricts printing the property more than 100 verses, restricts the Licensed Products to the Territory, and does not permit use of a Licensed Product or the Property on more than the number of devices as indicated by the developer upon sign up. User acknowledges DRM technology may contain errors and be subject to attempts to circumvent. User agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to limit the incidence of such errors and circumvention.

13. Updates and Removals

Updates. API.Bible may update, modify or discontinue any features, service, content or function of the API content, in whole or in part, from time to time (in each instance, an “Update”). You shall implement and use the most current version of the API content and make any changes to your Services that are required as a result of the Update, at your sole expense. Updates may adversely affect the way your Services access or communicate with the API.Bible API or display API.Bible Content. API.Bible will not be liable for damages of any sort that result from any Update.
Removals. If API.Bible content is deleted, gains protected status, or is otherwise suspended, withheld, modified, or removed from the API.Bible Applications (including removal of location information), you will make all reasonable efforts to delete or modify that Content (as applicable) as soon as possible, and in any case within twenty four (24) hours after a written request to do so by API.Bible, or by an IP Holder with regard to their API.Bible Content, unless prohibited by law or regulation and with the express written permission of API.Bible.
14. Fair Use Management System

FUMS is our Fair Use Management System. It is not a legal determination, but a system of internal review that we require all API developers to use in webapps as a way to help us ensure that the API contents are being used fairly. It also allows us to profile usage of the various versions, books, chapters, and verses that are requested from the API, so that we can communicate the value of API-accessible Scripture texts back to copyright holders and publishers. Additionally, we're in progress on a dashboard to communicate these same things back to the consumers of our API. For more information on FUMS, you can read a background on why it exists in the API Introduction. To start implementing FUMS in your application, visit our walk-through.

In short, we have a privacy focused solution that tracks scripture usage and anonymized user viewing data. At a minimum we only collect three pieces of information, and another if your service has logged in users. Here's what we collect:

FUMS Token. We'll show you how to get a FUMS token in just a moment, but for now this is a value that you'll receive from our servers when you make a request for any Scripture content. This is a value that represents the request and allows us to connect your FUMS report to a specific API request.
Device Id. This is a randomly generated id that is an anonymous representation of one specific device and is used for the lifetime of that device. This allows us to track usage at the device level. If you're using JavaScript tracker, this isn't something you'll ever need to worry about. Out of the box, we handle it for you.
Session Id. This also is a randomly generated id that is regenerated at the start of every session. It allows us to do analytics on how people engage with the scriptures in a given sitting. Like the device id, this is something we handle for you if you're using the JavaScript tracker.
User Id (Optional). If your application doesn't have logged in users, we don't need this value from you. If your application does have logged in users, we ask that you provide the id for the currently active user. This id should never contain any personally identifiable information. However, if you're using our JavaScript tracker, we make sure to obfuscate any value you give us by using the sha256 cryptographic hashing function. This prevents any user information from accidentally being leaked. We use this value to profile scripture engagement at the user level. While the device id allows us to do analytics at the device level, this gives us a better view into how users might be engaging with the scriptures using multiple devices or how multiple users might be sharing a single device.
15. API Documentation Reference

You agree to comply with any and all guidelines, requirements, and specifications set forth in the API.Bible API Documentation, which is incorporated by reference into these Terms and Conditions. The API Documentation may be updated from time to time, and your continued use of the API constitutes acceptance of any such updates. The current version of the API Documentation can be found at https://docs.api.bible.

16. Auditing Rights

API.Bible reserves the right to audit your use of the API content to ensure compliance with these Terms and Conditions. Upon reasonable notice from API.Bible, and no more than twice per calendar year (unless a previous audit revealed non-compliance), you shall provide API.Bible or its designated representative access to your relevant records, systems, and facilities to verify your compliance with these Terms and Conditions. You will provide free access to digital applications for API.Bible and/or the IP Holder of content in user’s applications. If any audit reveals that you have underpaid fees to API.Bible, you shall promptly pay such underpaid fees. If the underpaid fees exceed 5% of the total fees paid for the audited period, you shall also pay API.Bible's reasonable costs of conducting the audit.

17. Account Information

Developers agree to provide the following information truthfully and accurately to the fullest extent possible in order to use API.Bible and/or any of its features, services, and content. Much, if not all, of the information may be mandatory and required in order to use API.Bible and have access to any/or all content thereof.

Account/Organization - The developer will provide information about the organization, company and/or themselves if they are individuals as requested in the account creation process and user portal for API.Bible. This information may include, but is not limited to, name, country of location, and organization/user designation (e.g. non-profit, church, individual, etc) and legal non-profit status.
Application - The developer will provide information about the purpose of their application for which they will use their API key, the number of end users, commercial or noncommercial use, and other key details enabling API.Bible and relevant IP Holders to understand how the API and the API content is being used.
18. Term; Subscription Fees; Payment; Suspension, and Termination.

Term. The term of this Agreement will start on the earlier of the date you accept them or otherwise start accessing or using the API or any of the API content, and will continue until you stop accessing and using the API content, unless terminated earlier as described below.
Subscription Terms. Paid Services provided as part of API.Bible are made available as a recurring subscription service that provides access to certain features, content, benefits, or services, as described on the Developer Site and the Payment Portal. If you purchase Paid Services, you do so by paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis in accordance with the payment terms set forth below. When you subscribe to access the Paid Services via the Payment Portal, you expressly agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and that payments will be made by the payment method you have selected until the applicable Paid Services is canceled by you or by API.Bible, American Bible Society, or the Agreement is otherwise terminated. Your subscription to the Paid Service will automatically renew monthly until canceled in accordance with this Agreement. Your payment information will be automatically processed by API.Bible’s Payment Processor (defined below) at the start of each subscription period applicable to the Paid Services. If your payment information is declined, your subscription may be canceled until you provide new payment information for the applicable Paid Services. If you provide new payment information and your payment account is successfully charged, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date the successful charge took place. Prices for Paid Services are subject to change from time to time. API.Bible will provide reasonable advance notice of any material change to the price of Paid Services, which notice may be provided via the Developer Site. For subscription fees, price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by canceling your subscription to the applicable Paid Service prior to the price change going into effect.
Payment Terms. API.Bible may offer payment options that vary by Paid Service, device, operating system, geographic location, or other factors, which may be updated from time to time. These payment options may include web payments using a third party payment processor (“Payment Processor”). When you access a Paid Service, you agree: (i) to pay the price listed for the Paid Service, along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, credit card fees, bank fees, foreign transaction fees, foreign exchange fees, and currency fluctuations, on a recurring basis during the applicable subscription period; and (ii) to abide by any applicable terms of service, privacy policies, or other legal agreements or restrictions (including additional age restrictions) imposed by the Payment Processor in connection with your use of a given payment method. The subscription fee will automatically be applied at the start of the renewal period for the applicable subscription period unless you cancel the Paid Services on the Developer Site. It is your responsibility to make sure your banking, credit card, debit card, and/or other payment information is up to date, complete and accurate at all times. If you make a payment for a Paid Service through a Payment Processor, API.Bible may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto- renew, what platform you made the purchase on, and other information. API.Bible will not be liable for any errors made or delays by the Payment Processor, your bank, your credit card company or any payment network. All payments to API.Bible are non-refundable except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as required by law.
Taxes and fees. All fees exclude any and all taxes and similar fees now in force, enacted, or imposed in the future on the transaction, API.Bible API use, or the delivery of the API Content, including any sales, use or value added taxes, goods and services tax, consumption tax, customs duties, tariffs, or similar charges. These taxes may include, but are not limited to, VAT, GST, sales tax, withholding tax, and any other applicable taxes, but exclude taxes solely based on API.Bible’s net income. You are responsible for the payment of all such taxes, duties and charges, and any related penalties and interest arising from the payment of such amounts. Depending on your location, API.Bible may be responsible for collecting and reporting information related to transaction taxes arising from your purchase of Paid Services. You grant API.Bible permission to provide your account and personal information to relevant tax authorities to fulfill our tax collection and reporting obligations.
Canceling Your Subscription for Paid Services. Your subscription for Paid Services will automatically renew monthly unless you cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the end of your current subscription period. There are no refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods, including in a situation where certain features, benefits and/or services are modified or discontinued. SUBSCRIPTION PLANS ARE PREPAID, NON-REFUNDABLE (UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW), AND AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS CANCELED FOLLOWING THE CANCELLATION PROCEDURES BELOW. You may cancel your subscription for Paid Services at any time via the Developer Site and you will no longer have access to the Paid Services (or any features or functionality thereof) at the end of your then-current subscription term. When you cancel the Paid Services, your subscription will remain active from the time you cancel until the end of your current subscription period. You will not receive a refund or credit for any remaining days in your current subscription period, unless required by law. All payments for Paid Services are final and not refundable or exchangeable, except as required by applicable law. API.Bible makes no guarantee as to the nature, quality, or value of a Paid Service or the availability or supply thereof. Refunds or credits are not provided for any unused or partially used Paid Service (for example, a partially used subscription period). All Transactions are Final, unless you have a right to withdraw pursuant to law, such as provided below.
1. Withdrawal Right & Refunds for Users Living in EU or UK. When you purchase any Paid Services on subscription, you expressly agree to do so on a subscription basis and that the subscription will commence immediately on your date of purchase. If you are a consumer in an EU Member State or the UK, you agree you have fourteen (14) days after your purchase to withdraw from your contract for purchase for any reason.
2. No Withdrawal Right for Users Living in Taiwan. When you purchase Paid Services, you do so on a subscription basis, the subscription will commence immediately on your date of purchase, and the Paid Service is fully performed once begun. If you are in Taiwan, you agree that you can cancel your subscription for any Paid Services in accordance with subsection Canceling Your Subscription for Paid Services above, but that there is otherwise no right to rescind your Subscription and no refund will be issued.
Paid Services Are Non-Transferable between API.Bible Applications and Accounts. Each purchase of a Paid Service applies to a single API.Bible application, meaning that your purchase will apply solely to the application you were using when you purchased the Paid Service and will not apply to other applications or accounts that you may have access to, or control over. If you have or control multiple applications and you want access to Paid Services on each application, you must purchase the Paid Service on each application individually. You may not allow others to use your API.Bible user account or application to access any API content that such person did not order.
Restrictions and Obligations. You may only purchase and use a Paid Service or use the API content if you are legally allowed to use the API content in your country and you live in a country supported by API.Bible for the applicable Paid Service or API content.

You represent and warrant that you are not a Prohibited Person.

API.Bible will not be liable for damages of any sort that result from any such suspension.
Termination. API.Bible may terminate this Agreement for any reason, at API.Bible’s sole discretion. If you violate the terms of this Agreement, API.Bible may terminate this Agreement for cause immediately upon notice to you and you will not receive a prorated refund for any Paid Services. You may cancel your subscription for the Paid Services or your use of the API content on the Developer Site. Upon termination of this Agreement: (a) all licenses granted in this Agreement immediately expire and you must cease use of all API content; and (b) you shall permanently delete all API content in all forms and types of media, and copies thereof, in your possession.
