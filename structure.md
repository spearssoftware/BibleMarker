A tool that:
- helps you see a logical flow of thought in any passage, chapter, or book
- enables you to identify context, author’s purpose, and theme of book
- uses as a basis the 5W’s and an H   ….Who, What, When, Where, Why, How

 
The Basis and Value of Structuring
1.  Basis for structuring --- 5 W’s and an H   
 ….Who, What, When, Where, Why, How

2.  Structuring allows you to: 
a.	 Analyze sentences to identify:
1.	Who or what is doing the action (subject)
2.	What is the action (verb)
3.	How the subject or the action is described (modifiers)
b.	See complete thoughts at a glance
c.	   See how the supporting thoughts relate to the complete thoughts….Identify the Conjunctions:  How do they join thoughts:
1.	Time/Order – After, as, before, now, then, until, when, while
2.	Place – where, in, at, wherever
3.	Reason or cause – because, for, since, as, whereas, 
4.	Result – so, then, so then, therefore, thus
5.	Explanation – now, for
6.	Purpose –in order that, so that, that, 
7.	Contrast – although, but, nevertheless, however, yet, otherwise, where as
8.	Comparison – also, as so, just, just as, likewise, moreover
9.	Continuation – and, or, either … or, neither…nor
10.	Concession – although, even though
11.	Condition – if
12.	Emphatic – indeed, only

3.  Structuring forces you to:
a.	Think by reading with a purpose
b.	Keep from assuming before understanding
c.	Accurately handle the Word, book by book
d.	Slow down long enough for God to speak

The Process of Structuring:   The Mechanical Layout
1.	Write out the entire text, word for word.  
a.	Do not leave out any words.  
b.	Do not add any words.
c.	Leave words in the same order in which they occur.  Do not rearrange the words.
d.	Do not emphasize punctuation and chapter divisions.
2.	Independent Clauses:  Place the complete thoughts on the left side of the paper.  This is what the sentence is primarily talking about.   (…big picture)
3.	If a word or thought answers “when, where, why, or how” it is a supporting thought (dependent clause).  If it answers “who or what” it must be evaluated further….it might be a complete or supporting thought ... As often as possible, place the under or over the word or thought they describe, or indent and draw an arrow (maybe use a row of asterisk on a computer) back to the word being explained. 
4.	Realize that “for” indicates a supporting statement (except “for this reason” and/or “for this purpose”).
5.	As you read, consider whether a “who, what, where, why, or how” kind of question is being answered by the text.
6.	Know that there is no rigid way to do this, but it is possible to be wrong.  There is a right way, but there are many possibilities for what would still be considered correct.

Note: The introduction of most books is a greeting and does not follow the usual rules because the greeting is typically not a complete sentence.  Place the author and the recipients at the left margin and the supporting phrases are indented.

EXAMPLES:
Johnny went
to the store 			(where?)				
     	after school 			(when?)
     	to buy some medicine 	(why?)
                            	for his cold  
NOT RIGID… COULD DO:
Johnny went to the store 
     after school 
     to buy some medicine 
                             for his cold

BUT COULDN’T DO:
Johnny went to the store 
      after school 
     to buy some medicine 
                             for his cold 
Matt 6:1-4
1   "Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.
2   "When therefore you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be honored by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.
3   "But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
4   that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.              (NAS)
